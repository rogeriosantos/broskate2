# BroSkate Optimal Development Sequence

## Development Strategy

The development sequence is designed to:
1. **Establish solid foundations first** - Infrastructure and core systems
2. **Build incrementally** - Each phase builds upon the previous
3. **Validate early and often** - Test core assumptions before advanced features
4. **Minimize risk** - Critical path items completed early
5. **Enable parallel development** - Team members can work independently
