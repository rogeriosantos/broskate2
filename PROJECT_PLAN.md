- [ ] Database setup on Neon.tech with complete schema
- [ ] FastAPI backend with authentication and basic CRUD
- [ ] Docker containerization and Railway deployment
- [ ] Next.js frontend with routing and API integration
- [ ] Vercel deployment configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

#### Success Criteria:
- All services deployed and communicating
- Authentication flow working end-to-end
- Basic user registration/login functional

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 4-7)

- [ ] Real-time features (notifications, live updates)

#### Success Criteria:
- Mobile app feature parity with web
- Rich media sharing functional
- Event system working for shops
- Real-time updates functioning

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Weeks 12-14)
**Goal**: Performance optimization and production readiness

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Performance optimization (caching, indexing, CDN)
- [ ] Advanced mobile features (camera, GPS, push notifications)
- [ ] Analytics and monitoring implementation
- [ ] Community moderation tools
- [ ] Security audit and hardening

#### Success Criteria:
- App performs well under load
- Mobile features fully functional
- Monitoring and analytics in place
- Security requirements met

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team:
- 1 Full-stack developer (backend focus)
- 1 Frontend/Mobile developer
- 1 DevOps/Infrastructure engineer
- 1 UI/UX designer

### Technology Stack:
- Backend: FastAPI + Python 3.11+
- Database: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech)
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ with Tailwind CSS
- Mobile: React Native with Expo
- Deployment: Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing for location queries
- **Mobile Location Services**: Test extensively on real devices
- **Image Upload Scalability**: Plan CDN integration early

### Project Risks:
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features in each phase
- **Timeline Delays**: Build buffer into Phase 4 for catch-up
