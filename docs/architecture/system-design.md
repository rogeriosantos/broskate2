# BroSkate System Design

## Architecture Overview

BroSkate follows a modern full-stack architecture with separate frontend, mobile, and backend services.

## Component Responsibilities

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Purpose**: Web interface for BroSkate platform
- **Technology**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User interface and user experience
  - Client-side state management (TanStack Query + Zustand)
  - Authentication handling and route protection
  - Image optimization and lazy loading
  - SEO optimization and meta tags

### Mobile App (React Native)
- **Purpose**: Native mobile experience
- **Technology**: React Native with Expo
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Native mobile UI/UX
  - Camera integration for photo/video capture
  - GPS services for location-based features
  - Push notifications
  - Offline capabilities and caching

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Purpose**: REST API and business logic
- **Technology**: Python FastAPI with asyncpg
- **Responsibilities**:
  - API endpoints and request/response handling
  - Authentication and authorization (JWT)
  - Business logic and data validation
  - Database queries and transactions
  - File upload and processing
  - Real-time features (WebSockets)

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Purpose**: Data persistence and storage
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL on Neon.tech
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User, shop, and spot data storage
  - Relational data integrity
  - Geographic data indexing
  - Query performance optimization

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
```
Client → POST /api/auth/login → Backend → Database
                               ↓
Client ← JWT Token ← API Response
```

### Spot Discovery Flow
```
Client → GET /api/spots?lat=x&lng=y → Backend → Database (geo-query)
                                     ↓
Client ← Spot Data with Distance ← API Response
```

### Real-time Features Flow
```
Client ← WebSocket Connection → Backend
Client ← Push Notification ← Backend ← Event Trigger
```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- JWT tokens for authenticated users
- Guest access for browsing public content
- Token refresh mechanism for extended sessions
- Secure token storage recommendations

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (user, shop owner, admin)
- Resource-level permissions
- API endpoint protection
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Protection
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- File upload validation and size limits

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Geographic indexes for location queries
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling for concurrent requests
- Query optimization for complex joins

### Caching Strategy
- Client-side caching with TanStack Query
- API response caching for static content
- CDN for static assets and images
- Database query result caching

### Scalability
- Stateless backend design for horizontal scaling
- Database read replicas for query distribution
- Load balancing for high traffic
- Microservices migration path for future growth

## Integration Points

### Third-Party Services
- **Maps**: Mapbox or Google Maps for spot visualization
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary or AWS S3 for media files
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Push Service for mobile notifications
- **Analytics**: Custom analytics or third-party solution

### Internal APIs
- Authentication service integration
- File upload service
- Notification service
- Search and discovery engine

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Environment
```
Internet → CDN → Load Balancer → App Instances → Database
                      ↓              ↓
                 Static Assets   Application Logs
```

### Development Environment
- Local development with hot reload
- Database seeding and migrations
- Mock services for third-party integrations
- Testing environment with CI/CD pipeline

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics and alerts
- Uptime monitoring
- User experience tracking

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Server resource utilization
- Database performance metrics
- API endpoint response times
- Security incident detection

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Improvements
- Message queue for async processing
- Microservices architecture migration
- Read/write database splitting
- Event-driven architecture

### Feature Enhancements
- AI-powered spot recommendations
- Advanced social features
- Merchant/e-commerce integration
- Video streaming capabilities
